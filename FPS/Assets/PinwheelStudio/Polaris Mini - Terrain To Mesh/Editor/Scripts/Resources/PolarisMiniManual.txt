POLARIS MINI
MANUAL

I. OVERVIEW
Polaris Mini will convert a Unity terrain object to a regular mesh prefab, with material and textures.
Tree & detail exporting is not available at the moment.

II. HOW TO USE
1. Go to Window>Polaris Mini>Terrain To Mesh to open the editor window.

2. Drag & drop the terrain into the slot.

3. Fill the arguments under the MESH CREATION section:
- Width: size of the terrain on X-axis in local space.
- Height: size of the terrain on Y-axis in local space.
- Length: size of the terrain on Z-axis in local space.
- Mesh Base Resolution: the minimum resolution of geometry mesh.
- Mesh Resolution: the maximum resolution of geometry mesh where it has densest vertices distribution.
- Grid Size: how many chunks for the terrain mesh to split up on each X and Z axis. The total chunk is a square of this.
- LOD Count: the total LODs to generate.
- Displacement Seed: a random seed for vertex displacement.
- Displacement Strength: Strength of vertex displacement on XZ plane.
- Smooth Normal: toggle smooth shading. You can also use the G channel of the Mask Map to mix between sharp and smooth shading. See Smooth Normal Painting.
- Merge UV: map the UV coordinates to the center point of the triangle. This way you easily create a sharp look for triangle color.

4. Fill the arguments under the MATERIAL & TEXTURES section:
- Render Pipeline: The current render pipeline is in use.
- Material Template: The material "style" to apply the the prefab. 
 + Splat 4 No Normal: Use up to 4 texture layers with no normal map.
 + Color Map: Use Albedo & Metallic map with a regular Standard/Lit shader. Combining this with the Merge UV option above will produce a sharp colored terrain.
 + Other: Use a custom shader, where textures will be binded using the specified material properties.
- If you're using Custom material, then:
 + Material: The material of your choice.
 + Export Alpha Maps: Should it export the alpha maps? Check this if your shader use alpha map (layered textures).
 + Export Albedo Metallic Map: Should it export the albedo & metallic map? Check this if your shader is similar to Standard/Lit shader with albedo & metallic map.
 + Splat Control/Diffuse/Metallic/Smoothness name: Name of the properties corresponding to the texture layer. An index will be append to this to indicate the order of the property (e.g: _Control0, _Control1, _Splat0, _Splat1, etc.).
 + Albedo/Metallic Name: Name of the properties corresponding to the albedo & metallic texture.

5. Select a directory for the prefab under FILES section.

6. Click Convert.
